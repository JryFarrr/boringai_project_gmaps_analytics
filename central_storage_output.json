The burrata salad paired with crab and scallop fried rice is a standout dish, though some diners find the main courses, like salmon and wagyu beef, to be somewhat bland and lacking in sides. It's noted that the menu favors larger groups, as the substantial mains\u2014including steaks and lobsters\u2014are ideally suited for sharing. While the dining experience offers a photogenic setting, the food's overall flavor profile has left some customers wanting more, and concerns about the combined smoking and non-smoking areas have also been raised. Despite these drawbacks, the ambiance and service contribute to a generally positive impression of the restaurant.",
