They noticed that I needed a toothpick, they delivered it without me asking\u2026\nStarting from escargot, lobster bisque, steak and halibut, till souffle\u2026 c\u2019est delicieux!\nI would love to return with family and friends.  Nevertheless, the glass top dining area was a bit hot that they need to consider to put sun-protection stickers on to reduce the heat absorbed by the glass.",
