          "First time here and auto-love it!! Best hospitality from their F&B service staff, Best Taste in Food and Drink! I was so touched with their staff who really took care of their guests. They noticed that I needed a toothpick, they delivered it without me asking\u2026\nStarting from escargot, lobster bisque, steak and halibut, till souffle\u2026 c\u2019est delicieux!\nI would love to return with family and friends.  Nevertheless, the glass top dining area was a bit hot that they need to consider to put sun-protection stickers on to reduce the heat absorbed by the glass.",
          "Cobain beberapa makanan disini:\n1. Caesar salad: ini isinya just some lettuce aja i think, and crouton, and an egg. Nothing special sih. Taste good, but similar with the others.\n2. Truffle pasta: enak sih ini! Pastanya al dente. Bumbunya creamy, cheesy,dan seasoningnya pas. Ga ada yg over. But there's no topping on there ya. Simply pasta, sauce, and slice of truffle aja, so better order another menu\n3. Contre filet : ini black angus meat. I ordered medium. Matangnya sih sebetulnya pas ya. But since they served it on a hotplate, jd proses cookingnya tetep jalan ya. So if you dont eat it fast, they will be well done. Anw for the meat is really good. The sauce is unique but mixed quite well\n4. White ham & truffle oil pizza: tekstur pizza nya yg cukup tebal ya. Dan cukup mengenyangkan for share up to 2-3 persons. But i dont know why, actually i expect it will be full of truffle aroma, but unfortunately its not.\n5. Pork belly kurobuta: out of all the menu, this one is my least favorite. The pork itself is not really crispy, and i still smell quite strong aroma of the pork meat there, which is not really good. But the rest is okay\n6. Mont blanc: quite good for the dessert. Its creamy, and have caramel sauce on it\n\nOverall, for the service and the ambiance i have nothing to complain, yea worth the price. The food overall was also good and give me pleasant experience."

      "First time here and auto-love it!! Best hospitality from their F&B service staff, Best Taste in Food and Drink! I was so touched with their staff who really took care of their guests. They noticed that I needed a toothpick, they delivered it without me asking\u2026\nStarting from escargot, lobster bisque, steak and halibut, till souffle\u2026 c\u2019est delicieux!\nI would love to return with family and friends.  Nevertheless, the glass top dining area was a bit hot that they need to consider to put sun-protection stickers on to reduce the heat absorbed by the glass.",
      "Cobain beberapa makanan disini:\n1. Caesar salad: ini isinya just some lettuce aja i think, and crouton, and an egg. Nothing special sih. Taste good, but similar with the others.\n2. Truffle pasta: enak sih ini! Pastanya al dente. Bumbunya creamy, cheesy,dan seasoningnya pas. Ga ada yg over. But there's no topping on there ya. Simply pasta, sauce, and slice of truffle aja, so better order another menu\n3. Contre filet : ini black angus meat. I ordered medium. Matangnya sih sebetulnya pas ya. But since they served it on a hotplate, jd proses cookingnya tetep jalan ya. So if you dont eat it fast, they will be well done. Anw for the meat is really good. The sauce is unique but mixed quite well\n4. White ham & truffle oil pizza: tekstur pizza nya yg cukup tebal ya. Dan cukup mengenyangkan for share up to 2-3 persons.
