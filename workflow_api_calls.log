Fortunately, the hostess was kind and accommodating, and managed to find me a table in a private dining room setting. I ordered a selection of their signature dishes and personal favorites\u2014and every single one turned out to be delightful. This was my first visit, and certainly the first of many to come.",
      "Overall had a really great evening, the service was amazing, cocktails were fantastic, the food was good. The cauliflower steak was amazing and my favourite dish of the evening. We received a beautiful Birthday treat for our son which was such a nice gesture. Overall great experience."

Truly appreciate the art, experience, uniqueness, and effort that is being put in every dish, then ended with a simple yet my fav dessert but there's a hint of funsies. I'd say for the price is worth it for a first time experience! And props to every friendly servers/workers/security there, Excellent customer service \ud83e\udd29",

I have to say it was a great experience, the level of creativity it takes to come up with such food presentation is just amazing. The food tasted great and yes the serving time between each course takes slightly longer than you are used to due to slightly shortage of waitress when its full, but who wants to hurry when you are to to enjoy this kind of experience?\n\nI read some review reporting negativity at this place where its ordinary and yet I still go and I have to say, maybe you expect too much with the amount you pay, for me, the ideas and creativity is priceless and I would highly reccomend this place for anyone who wants a unique experience with their food presentation, a definitely must try. The way the food surprises you from it looks makes you wonder how the chef even come up with this idea? Each course is explained thoroughly of what it is or what it might be and it makes the dining different from your typical fine dining, it adds that little bit of fun to it.\n\nAs for the venue, yes it requires slight renovating to keep it up to date, but, remember, Indonesian Chef, Indonesian Cuisine, with International level of creativity and technique, you have to excuse the minor setbacks and support the achievement. For the same kind of presentation overseas you will pay 5x more than what you pay here. I will definitely come back each time they changed the menu just to see what amazing things can the chef accomplish."

          "Their burrata salad tasted really nice. I always get that with their crab and scallop fried rice, 100/10!\n\nOther than that, coming alone especially when you\u2019re very hungry doesn\u2019t seem like the best idea. Their main dishes don\u2019t really come with sides which I thought was so weird. For example, if you ordered their salmon, you only get veggies on the side. They do serve potatoes separately as an add-on, which is quite funny haha\n\nIt\u2019s best to come here with 5+ people since their main menu consists of steaks or lobsters that start with a few hundred grams.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t really like the concept of them combining the smoking area with nonsmoking despite being indoors.

      "Their burrata salad tasted really nice. I always get that with their crab and scallop fried rice, 100/10!\n\nOther than that, coming alone especially when you\u2019re very hungry doesn\u2019t seem like the best idea. Their main dishes don\u2019t really come with sides which I thought was so weird. For example, if you ordered their salmon, you only get veggies on the side. They do serve potatoes separately as an add-on, which is quite funny haha\n\nIt\u2019s best to come here with 5+ people since their main menu consists of steaks or lobsters that start with a few hundred grams.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t really like the concept of them combining the smoking area with nonsmoking despite being indoors. We breathe the same air, and I don\u2019t want to be near smokers..",

Patrons rave about signature dishes like the burrata salad and crab and scallop fried rice, although the main dishes lack sides, prompting some to recommend dining with larger groups to fully enjoy the substantial entrees like steaks and lobsters. While the ambiance and decor earn high praise, some reviewers note that the food can be hit-or-miss, with particular dishes being bland or not meeting expectations. Additionally, the combination of smoking and non-smoking areas indoors is a concern for some diners. Overall, Sofia is recognized more for its aesthetic appeal than for consistently memorable cuisine.",

          "Big beautiful restaurant in southern part of jakarta. they are famous for the catering service but this place is their signature restaurant with big dining areas, outdoor space as well as rooms with bars.\n\nMenu is great, featuring a lot of choices of Indonesian traditional.cuisines and beyond. The taste is great, the presentation is also lovely.\n\nWe came here for brunch and we ended up ordering a lot of food. I tried their lontong sayur, laksa, grilled lamb shank, jagung muda bakar, sop iga bakar, nasi campur, otak - otak, singkong goreng and more.\n\nService is great and fast. Staff are very helpful and friendly.\n\nThe have mushola or the praying room above on the 2nd floor. It has additional toilets and ablution corner as well. Very handy.",
          "Good place for Indonesian food if you\u2019re foreigner. The staff is very friendly and the food taste is not too strong in herbs and other Indonesian seasoning, but it is too mild for my taste (Indonesian native taste).\n\nLocation wise the place is quite hidden in the usually crowded street of South Jakarta office complex (between Kemang area and Blok M).\n\nMany of my local friends said that the soup dish lacks the punch of usual Indonesian style cooking, but my foreigner friends love it. I ordered Nasi Umara, rice combo with many small beef style cooking with sambal and it was okay, the price is also directed toward fine dining experience as opposed of family style dining.\n\nThe other highlight in the menu is the \u2018Ayam Goreng Bawang Putih\u2019 dish. The taste of garlic is very tantalizing to my palette and the half chicken size portion is excellent for 3-4 people sharing if each person ordered another dish.\n\nMight go back here with foreigner friends, but for myself I think there are many options available for the dishes offered in the menu nearby as well.\n\nThe place also has multiple VIP rooms with minimum charge of IDR250k - IDR350k ++ per person."

While the service is noted for being friendly and efficient, some local patrons feel that the flavors could be bolder, contrasting with the more subtle taste that foreign guests tend to appreciate. The restaurant's convenient facilities, including a prayer room and adequate restrooms, add to its appeal, although it is somewhat hidden amidst the busy streets.

The ambience was also a highlight, with both outdoor seating for those who enjoy natural sunlight and a laidback vibe, and indoor areas offering a quieter, more refined atmosphere. Highly recommend.",

In the shift there were Riyan, Faisal, Diki, Aziza, Sandra, and Daniel on the floor, led by the local legend Pak Ahmadi. Riyan and Pak Ahmadi took a great care of me, we also chat about many interesting stories surrounding food and history of the hotel. In the end, Pak Ahmadi asked me if I want my coffee to go, such a nice gesture.\n\nThank you for making my day, I can\u2019t wait to come back! :)"

      "Stayed here for 2 nights with breakfast included. While the breakfast selection wasn\u2019t extensive, the quality of the food was excellent. All the staff were warm, attentive, and made us feel welcome, especially Pak Arya and one of the older staff (forgot his name) who was kind enough to share some of his knowledge about Jamu. The ambience was also a highlight, with both outdoor seating for those who enjoy natural sunlight and a laidback vibe, and indoor areas offering a quieter, more refined atmosphere. Highly recommend.",
      "Always a good time when coming back to Jakarta Restaurant. I had a pleasant breakfast \u2014 spoiled to be exact! Service was impeccable, staff were very attentive. In the shift there were Riyan, Faisal, Diki, Aziza, Sandra, and Daniel on the floor, led by the local legend Pak Ahmadi. Riyan and Pak Ahmadi took a great care of me, we also chat about many interesting stories surrounding food and history of the hotel. In the end, Pak Ahmadi asked me if I want my coffee to go, such a nice gesture.\n\nThank you for making my day, I can\u2019t wait to come back! :)"

Come hungry with friends, as you will not be able to make up your mind and the portions are big enough for sharing. It is a bit expensive, but I usually eat half and take home the rest for a second meal. Beautiful food, lovely atmosphere and attentive staff. What started off as a Mother's Day treat 10 years ago has turned into a habit!\n\nThis time I had a spicy walnut-chili-pomegranate dip, the vegetable baked and some minced chicken kebabs with a gorgeous spices rice. I managed half of everything and was STUFFED. I am not a foodie pic person, but wanted to show for an idea of the generous portions. Also, their baklava is wonderful and the tea selection is great.",
          "We had a great experience at Turkuaz Restaurant for our Ramadhan iftar gathering. The ambiance was warm and elegant, with beautiful Turkish decor that made us feel like we were dining in Istanbul.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious, from the appetizers to the main courses. The mezze platters were flavorful, and the grilled meats were tender and well-seasoned.\n\nHowever, the serving time for the main dishes took a bit longer than expected, which was slightly challenging for an iftar gathering when everyone is eager to eat after fasting. It would be great if service could be a bit quicker, especially for large groups during peak hours.\n\nOverall, Turkuaz is an excellent place to enjoy authentic Turkish cuisine, and we will definitely return. If you're visiting during busy times, I recommend making a reservation and ordering ahead if possible."

      "Turkuaz is always delicious, and the service prompt and attentive without being overwhelming. Whether you want a teatime treat, or a full on meal, this is a go-to. Come hungry with friends, as you will not be able to make up your mind and the portions are big enough for sharing. It is a bit expensive, but I usually eat half and take home the rest for a second meal. Beautiful food, lovely atmosphere and attentive staff. What started off as a Mother's Day treat 10 years ago has turned into a habit!\n\nThis time I had a spicy walnut-chili-pomegranate dip, the vegetable baked and some minced chicken kebabs with a gorgeous spices rice. I managed half of everything and was STUFFED. I am not a foodie pic person, but wanted to show for an idea of the generous portions. Also, their baklava is wonderful and the tea selection is great.",
      "We had a great experience at Turkuaz Restaurant for our Ramadhan iftar gathering. The ambiance was warm and elegant, with beautiful Turkish decor that made us feel like we were dining in Istanbul.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious, from the appetizers to the main courses. The mezze platters were flavorful, and the grilled meats were tender and well-seasoned.\n\nHowever, the serving time for the main dishes took a bit longer than expected, which was slightly challenging for an iftar gathering when everyone is eager to eat after fasting. It would be great if service could be a bit quicker, especially for large groups during peak hours.\n\nOverall, Turkuaz is an excellent place to enjoy authentic Turkish cuisine, and we will definitely return. If you're visiting during busy times, I recommend making a reservation and ordering ahead if possible."

      "Penn Jakarta brings a slice of New York's vibrant nightlife to the heart of the city, though the culinary execution can be hit or miss. However, Penn truly shines in its beverage program. Their extensive cocktail menu showcases both creativity and craftsmanship, offering something for every palate. Whether you're a cocktail connoisseur or just looking for a well-made drink, their skilled bartenders have got you covered.\n\nThe real star here is the atmosphere. Penn has successfully created a space that buzzes with energy, particularly during their regular events. The Lindy Hop night transforms the venue into a vivacious throwback to the swing era, complete with dancing couples and infectious enthusiasm. This commitment to curating experiences, rather than just serving food and drinks, sets Penn apart in Jakarta's nightlife scene.\n\nFor those seeking a night out with character, Penn delivers on ambiance and spirits, even if some menu items need fine-tuning.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b"

The drink was visually stunning, served in a tall glass filled with refreshing ice and topped with a generous scoop of vibrant berry sorbet. A sprig of fresh mint added a beautiful touch of color and a hint of aromatic freshness.\n\nThe flavor was a perfect balance between the floral, slightly tart notes of hibiscus and the sweet, fruity richness of the sorbet. The fizziness gave it a lively, refreshing finish, making it an ideal choice for a hot afternoon. Every sip was both invigorating and satisfying, with the sorbet gradually melting and blending into the tea, enhancing the flavor even more.\n\nOverall, the Hibiscus Fizz Tea is a wonderful treat for anyone looking for a unique, refreshing, and beautifully presented beverage. I would highly recommend it and will definitely be ordering it again."

Every sip was both invigorating and satisfying, with the sorbet gradually melting and blending into the tea, enhancing the flavor even more.\n\nOverall, the Hibiscus Fizz Tea is a wonderful treat for anyone looking for a unique, refreshing, and beautifully presented beverage. I would highly recommend it and will definitely be ordering it again."
